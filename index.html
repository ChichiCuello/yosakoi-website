                    <p class="text">Yosakoi is a dynamic and captivating dance style that originates from Japan. It is a unique blend of traditional Japanese dance and modern movement, characterized by its vibrancy, energy, and large group performances. <br>
                    <br>
                    Yosakoi is typically performed at festivals and events throughout Japan, and its popularity has spread globally. The dance is more than just a performance; it is a celebration of culture, community, and creativity that is accessible to everyone, regardless of age or experience with dance. </p>

                        The Yosakoi dance was created in an effort to rebuild the city of Kōchi, which was completely destroyed by the Great Kōchi Air Raid in 1945. The dance was shaped by "ozashiki culture" - a form of entertainment involving traditional performing arts and geishas, prevalent from the end of the Edo period to the Meiji period in Tosa, Kōchi Prefecture. <br>
                        <br>
                        The Yosakoi Naruko Dance, performed at the Yosakoi Festival, was created by masters of the five schools of Japanese dance. The dance incorporated a Tosa folk song called "Yosakoi Bushi" and was based on the "Yosakoi Dance" that was sung and danced in tatami rooms. Composer Eisaku Takemasa created new music for this dance, which formed the basis for the festival. <br>
                        <br>
                        The Yosakoi Festival has since become a "citizen festival" that anyone can participate in. As a platform for dancers to express themselves, it continues to evolve and spread throughout the country and overseas. </p>

                        Naruko, small wooden clappers, are a defining feature of Yosakoi. Originally used in Kōchi Prefecture to scare birds away from rice fields. <br>
                        <br>
                        Traditionally, the Naruko has black and yellow beaters on a wooden body. However, modern Yosakoi groups often create their own Naruko, choosing colors and materials that match their costumes.

                        The costumes are a feast for the eyes. They range from Happi coats and Yukata in a myriad of colors to outfits inspired by historical, popular, or ethnic fashions. <br>
                        <br>
                        Each team usually sports similar costumes, adding a visual sense of unity to their performance.

                        In many cases, the makeup also reflects traditional Japanese aesthetics, further infusing the dance with a sense of cultural heritage.
